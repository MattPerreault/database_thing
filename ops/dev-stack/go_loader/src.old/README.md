# Logging
This code is defining a package named "logger" which is used for logging in the main go package. It is importing the "log" and "time" packages as well as the "go.uber.org/zap" package, which is a logging framework for Go.

The InitializeLogger function creates a new production logger using the zap package and assigns it to the variable Logger. The function also uses the logger's Sugar method to log a message at the "info" level, providing structured context as key-value pairs. The defer statement ensures that the logger's Sync method is called before the function returns, ensuring that any buffered log entries are written to their final destination.

The LoggingMiddleware function is defined to return a gin.HandlerFunc, which is a function that takes a pointer to a gin.Context struct and logs request details such as method, URL, status, and elapsed time. This function uses the Logger variable's Info method to log a message at the "info" level and providing structured context as key-value pairs.
